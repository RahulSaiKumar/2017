# Star-Wars-Franchise
Which is the best movie in the Franchise?

The dataset used in this analysis is downloaded from the guided project from the site "dataquest.io". So full credit for the dataset goes to them. It was made prior to the release of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens". The original data was collected and compiled by "fivethirtyeight" by doing an online survey on people who have watched the Star Wars Franchise.

The data has several columns, including:

Header| Description
---|-------
`RespondentID` | An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)
`Gender` | The respondent's gender
`Age` | The respondent's age
`Household Income` | The respondent's income
`Education` | The respondent's education level
`Location (Census Region)` | The respondent's location
`Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise?` | Has a Yes or No response
`Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise?` | Has a Yes or No response


While doing this analysis I used two differents ways of visualization, the first half was presented using an easy and clear to understand visualization while the second half was presented using a visualization with more depth of data that requires somes time to understand.
