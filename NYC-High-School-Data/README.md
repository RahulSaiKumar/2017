# NYC-High-School-Data

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. The SAT has three sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.

New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets.
